# MATH_2859
Implementations of some Statistical Concepts (MATH 2(85|0(8|9))9)

## Intro

The course officially uses Matlab as the main programming language / tool.
However, the software is not freely accessed and so this repository is created 
to facilitate the transition to open-sourced resources such as GNU Octave, Python 
and its related  packages.



### Setup

```bash
virtualenv bin
source bin/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### License

## Implemetations (by Week and Topics)
